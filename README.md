# React Native Reddit iOS App

## Instructions for Use

Download this repo, run `npm i`, and then `react-native run-ios`.

The app will display a `ListView` of Reddit's front page posts. Tapping an item with a link will open the browser, otherwise tapping a self post will open a view with the content of the self post.
